<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hey there, I'm Nandini M Prakash, a second year B.Tech Computer Science student at NIT Calicut! This is my very first website as such, and I'm really keen on developing my web development skills since it's something I really enjoy!
  I love learning new skills, and I'm currently exploring various domains like AI/ML, Web Development, Data Analytics, UI/UX and Designing, to name a few. 
</p>

<p>
  Web Development is something which interested me from the beginning, and I really hope to enhance my knowledge and make real working websites, and work on improving myself.
  I enjoy the whole learning process, and never miss an opportunity to analyze and correct my mistakes.
</p>

<p>
  Hoping to create and build up more creative websites soon! See you!
